## Pre-requisties
* Linux

* Python>=3.7

* NVIDIA GPU (memory>=30G) + CUDA cuDNN

## Strat evaluating
### Install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Download the checkpoint
Our modelâ€˜s best checkpoint is located at the link below, you can download it freely.

### Evaluation
If you want to get the mAP value, run the following command:
```
python val.py
```
If you want to get the images with bounding boxes, run the following command:
```
python detect.py
```
If you have a GPU cluster, I also provide you with a script file using sbatch to submit, and you can run it with:
```
sbatch yolov5_val.sh/sbatch yolov5_detect.sh
```
**Tips**: You can also use "--" to add parameters in the runing command according to yourslef.
E.g. If I want to output a txt file with the order of "Image name Confidence coefficient Coordinates", you can run the command below:
```
python detect.py --save-txt --save-conf
```
